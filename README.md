NHL Companion is a webstite hosted at nhlcompanion.com that allows users to automiatically play the goal horn of their favorite team when their team scores. 
Data is pulled from the NHL's public API and is refreshed to determine if a goal was scored. 
Data is also stored in a MySQL database to display schedules, standings, and team info. 

This is a passion project. This project is in no way affiliated with the NHL.
